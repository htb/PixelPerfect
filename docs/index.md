Using iOS and Swift

This is about avoiding aliasing and interpolation when drawing on iOS devices.

Specfically for the use case of drawing barcodes and other images for optical reading, where exact pixel representation is significant.

This project contains an Xcode workspace for a barcode scanner app and an app demonstrating the aliasing and interpolation in the accompanying tutorial.
